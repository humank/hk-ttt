# Domain Model Python Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing the Opportunity Management Service domain model in Python. The implementation will be simple and intuitive, with a flat directory structure and in-memory repositories.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1: Set up Project Structure**
  - Create necessary directories
  - Create empty files for all entities
  - Set up common utilities and base classes

- [x] **Step 2: Implement Enumerations**
  - Create enums for Priority, Status, SkillType, ImportanceLevel, ProficiencyLevel
  - Use Python's Enum class for type safety

- [x] **Step 3: Implement Base Entity**
  - Create a base entity class with common attributes (id, createdAt, updatedAt)
  - Implement common functionality for all entities

- [x] **Step 4: Implement Value Objects**
  - Create GeographicRequirements value object
  - Create any other necessary value objects

- [x] **Step 5: Implement Core Entities**
  - Implement User class
  - Implement Customer class
  - Implement SkillsCatalog class
  - Implement Opportunity class
  - Implement ProblemStatement class
  - Implement SkillRequirement class
  - Implement TimelineRequirement class
  - Implement OpportunityStatus class
  - Implement Attachment class
  - Implement ChangeRecord class

- [x] **Step 6: Implement Validation Logic**
  - Create validators for each entity
  - Implement business rules as validation methods

- [x] **Step 7: Implement Repository Interfaces**
  - Define repository interfaces for each entity
  - Ensure they follow a consistent pattern

- [x] **Step 8: Implement In-Memory Repositories**
  - Create in-memory implementations of repository interfaces
  - Include methods for CRUD operations and queries

- [x] **Step 9: Implement Service Layer**
  - Create service classes for business operations
  - Implement methods that coordinate between entities and repositories

- [x] **Step 10: Implement Exception Handling**
  - Create custom exception classes
  - Implement proper exception handling throughout the codebase

- [x] **Step 11: Write Unit Tests**
  - Create test cases for entities
  - Create test cases for repositories
  - Create test cases for services
  - Test business rules and constraints

- [x] **Step 12: Create Sample Usage Examples**
  - Create example scripts showing how to use the implementation
  - Include examples for common workflows

## Questions for Clarification

[Question] Should we implement a simple event system for notifications (e.g., when an opportunity is cancelled)?
[Answer] Yes

[Question] What should be the minimum character count for problem statements?
[Answer] 140

[Question] Should we implement a simple authentication/authorization mechanism or assume it's handled elsewhere?
[Answer] It's handled elsewhere

[Question] Should we implement any specific validation for file attachments (size limits, allowed file types)?
[Answer] 20MB and supports all file types

[Question] Do we need to implement any specific logging mechanism or use Python's standard logging?
[Answer] Use Python's standard logging
