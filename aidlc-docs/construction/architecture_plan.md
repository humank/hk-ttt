# Architecture Plan for Exposing Opportunity Management Service

This document outlines the plan for exposing the Opportunity Management Service methods to be consumed by clients over the internet. The service will be hosted on AWS following the Well-Architected Framework principles.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework Considerations

1. **Operational Excellence**
   - Implement infrastructure as code using AWS CDK or CloudFormation
   - Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

2. **Security**
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Encrypt data in transit and at rest
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Set up WAF and Shield for DDoS protection

3. **Reliability**
   - Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
   - Implement auto-scaling
   - Set up health checks and automated recovery

4. **Performance Efficiency**
   - Choose appropriate instance types
   - Implement caching where applicable
   - Use serverless architecture for better scalability

5. **Cost Optimization**
   - Use serverless to pay only for what you use
   - Implement auto-scaling to match demand
   - Set up cost monitoring and alerts

6. **Sustainability**
   - Choose energy-efficient services
   - Optimize resource utilization

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1: Analyze Service Requirements**
  - Identify all methods to be exposed
  - Determine authentication and authorization requirements
  - Identify data models and serialization needs
  - Analyze expected traffic patterns and performance requirements

- [x] **Step 2: Choose API Architecture**
  - Evaluate REST vs GraphQL
  - Define API endpoints and operations
  - Design request/response formats
  - Design error handling approach

- [x] **Step 3: Select AWS Services**
  - Choose compute service (Lambda, ECS, EKS, etc.)
  - Choose API management service (API Gateway, AppSync)
  - Choose database service
  - Choose additional supporting services

- [x] **Step 4: Design Authentication and Authorization**
  - Choose authentication service (Cognito, custom JWT, etc.)
  - Define authorization rules
  - Design token validation and handling

- [x] **Step 5: Design Infrastructure Architecture**
  - Design network architecture (VPC, subnets, security groups)
  - Design service deployment architecture
  - Design database architecture
  - Design caching strategy

- [x] **Step 6: Implement API Layer**
  - Create API definitions
  - Implement request/response serialization
  - Implement error handling
  - Implement authentication and authorization

- [x] **Step 7: Adapt Service Layer**
  - Modify service layer to work with API layer
  - Implement dependency injection for repositories
  - Implement transaction management

- [x] **Step 8: Implement Infrastructure as Code**
  - Create CDK or CloudFormation templates
  - Define CI/CD pipelines
  - Set up monitoring and logging

- [x] **Step 9: Implement Testing**
  - Create unit tests
  - Create integration tests
  - Create load tests
  - Create security tests

- [x] **Step 10: Deploy and Validate**
  - Deploy to development environment
  - Run tests
  - Fix issues
  - Deploy to production

## Questions for Clarification

[Question] What is the expected traffic volume and pattern for the API (requests per second, peak times)?
[Answer] 100 requests per second with peaks of up to 500 requests during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM EST).

[Question] Are there any specific latency requirements for the API responses?
[Answer] API responses should be under 200ms for read operations and under 500ms for write operations.

[Question] What are the authentication and authorization requirements for the API?
[Answer] OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens. Role-based access control with Sales Manager and Admin roles.

[Question] Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
[Answer] GDPR compliance is required as we will store data of EU citizens.

[Question] What is the expected deployment frequency for the service?
[Answer] Weekly deployments for feature updates and daily deployments for critical bug fixes.

[Question] Should the API be public or private (VPC-only)?
[Answer] Public API with proper authentication and authorization.

[Question] What is the expected data volume and growth rate for the database?
[Answer] Starting with 10GB of data, expected to grow by 1GB per month.

[Question] Are there any existing AWS services or infrastructure that this service needs to integrate with?
[Answer] Yes, it needs to integrate with an existing Amazon Cognito user pool and Amazon RDS database.
