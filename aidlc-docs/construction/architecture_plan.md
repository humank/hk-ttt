# Architecture Plan: Expose Opportunity Management Service Methods Over Internet (Local Deployment)

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to expose all methods from the OpportunityService and AttachmentService classes to clients over the internet using a RESTful API architecture with local deployment using FastAPI/Flask and containerization.

## Architecture Plan Steps

### Phase 1: API Design and Documentation
- [x] **Step 1.1: Analyze Service Methods**
  - Review all methods in OpportunityService and AttachmentService
  - Map service methods to RESTful API endpoints
  - Define request/response schemas for each endpoint
  
- [x] **Step 1.2: Create OpenAPI Specification**
  - Create comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification
  - Define all endpoints, request/response schemas, and error responses
  - Include authentication and authorization requirements
  
  [Question] What authentication method would you prefer? (JWT tokens, Session-based, API Keys, or other)?
  [Answer] None.
  
  [Question] Do you need any specific API versioning strategy beyond the current v1 approach?
  [Answer] No.
  
- [x] **Step 1.3: Define API Framework Configuration**
  - Choose web framework (FastAPI recommended for auto-generated OpenAPI docs)
  - Define request validation rules
  - Configure CORS settings for web clients
  
  [Question] What are the expected client types? (Web applications, mobile apps, server-to-server, etc.)
  [Answer] Web Applications
  
  [Question] Do you need specific CORS origins or should it be open for development?
