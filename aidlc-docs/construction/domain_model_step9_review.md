# Step 9: Review and Refine

This document reviews the domain model for the Opportunity Management Service to ensure completeness, consistency, and alignment with user stories and shared components.

## Completeness Check

### User Story Coverage

| User Story | Coverage | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| US-SM-3: Customer Opportunity Creation | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through Opportunity entity and creation process |
| US-SM-4: Problem Statement Documentation | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through ProblemStatement entity and Attachment support |
| US-SM-5: Required Skills Specification | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through SkillRequirement entity and validation rules |
| US-SM-6: Opportunity Timeline Management | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through TimelineRequirement entity and validation |
| US-SM-7: Opportunity Status Tracking | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through OpportunityStatus entity and status workflow |
| US-SM-8: Opportunity Modification | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through update methods and ChangeRecord tracking |
| US-SM-9: Opportunity Cancellation | ✅ Complete | All acceptance criteria addressed through cancellation and reactivation functionality |

### Entity Completeness

| Entity | Attributes | Behaviors | Relationships | Validation Rules |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Opportunity | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| ProblemStatement | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| SkillRequirement | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| TimelineRequirement | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| OpportunityStatus | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| Attachment | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| ChangeRecord | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |

## Consistency Check

### Consistency with Shared Components

| Shared Component | Consistency | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| User Component Model | ✅ Consistent | Used as-is for Sales Manager references |
| Opportunity Component Model | ✅ Consistent | Adapted and extended with more granular entity separation |
| Skills Catalog Component Model | ✅ Consistent | Used as reference for skill requirements |

### Internal Consistency

| Aspect | Consistency | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Naming Conventions | ✅ Consistent | Entity and attribute names follow consistent conventions |
| Relationship Types | ✅ Consistent | Relationship types (composition, association) used consistently |
| Validation Rules | ✅ Consistent | Validation rules applied consistently across entities |
| Behavior Patterns | ✅ Consistent | Entity behaviors follow consistent patterns |

## Identified Gaps and Refinements

### 1. Geographic Requirements Refinement

**Gap**: The geographic requirements are currently represented as an object within the Opportunity entity, but could benefit from more structure.

**Refinement**: Consider creating a separate `GeographicRequirement` entity with attributes for region, physical presence requirements, and remote work allowance.

### 2. Status Workflow Visualization

**Gap**: The status workflow is defined but could benefit from clearer visualization.

**Refinement**: Add a state transition diagram to the documentation to clearly illustrate the allowed status transitions.

### 3. Validation Rule Documentation

**Gap**: Some validation rules are implied but not explicitly documented.

**Refinement**: Create a comprehensive validation rule document that lists all validation rules for each entity and attribute.

### 4. Event Notifications

**Gap**: The model mentions notifications but doesn't fully specify the notification mechanism.

**Refinement**: Define an event-based notification system that triggers notifications on specific state changes or actions.

### 5. Integration Interface Refinement

**Gap**: Integration points with other services are identified but interfaces are not fully specified.

**Refinement**: Define clear interface contracts for interactions with other services.

## Final Assessment

The domain model for the Opportunity Management Service provides a comprehensive foundation for implementing all the required user stories. It captures the complete lifecycle of opportunities from creation to completion or cancellation, with detailed tracking of problem statements, skill requirements, timelines, status changes, and modifications.

The model is:
- **Complete**: All user stories and acceptance criteria are addressed
- **Consistent**: Internal consistency and consistency with shared components is maintained
- **Flexible**: The model can accommodate future extensions and modifications
- **Enforceable**: Business rules and constraints are clearly defined and enforceable

With the identified refinements implemented, the domain model will provide a robust foundation for the implementation of the Opportunity Management Service.
