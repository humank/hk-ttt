# Domain Model Design Plan

This plan outlines the steps to design a comprehensive domain model for the Opportunity Management Service based on the user stories in `aidlc-docs/inception/units/opportunity_management_service.md`.

## Plan Steps

- [x] **Step 1: Analyze User Stories**
  - Review all user stories to identify key entities, attributes, and behaviors
  - Extract business rules and constraints from acceptance criteria
  - Identify relationships between entities

- [x] **Step 2: Identify Core Domain Entities**
  - Determine primary entities needed for the Opportunity Management Service
  - Map entities to user stories to ensure complete coverage
  - Identify which shared components from `shared_model.md` to reuse

- [x] **Step 3: Define Entity Attributes and Behaviors**
  - Define attributes for each entity based on user stories
  - Define behaviors (methods/operations) for each entity
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are addressed

- [x] **Step 4: Design Entity Relationships**
  - Define relationships between entities (associations, aggregations, compositions)
  - Determine multiplicity of relationships
  - Identify dependency directions

- [x] **Step 5: Incorporate Shared Components**
  - Integrate relevant shared components from `shared_model.md`
  - Ensure consistency with shared data models
  - Extend shared components as needed for specific requirements

- [x] **Step 6: Define Business Rules and Constraints**
  - Document business rules extracted from user stories
  - Define validation rules and constraints
  - Specify state transitions and allowed operations

- [x] **Step 7: Create Domain Model Diagram**
  - Create a UML class diagram showing entities, attributes, behaviors, and relationships
  - Include multiplicity and relationship types
  - Add notes for important business rules

- [x] **Step 8: Document Domain Model**
  - Create comprehensive documentation for the domain model
  - Include descriptions of entities, attributes, behaviors, and relationships
  - Document business rules and constraints
  - Explain how the model addresses each user story

- [x] **Step 9: Review and Refine**
  - Review the model for completeness against user stories
  - Check for consistency with shared components
  - Identify and resolve any gaps or inconsistencies

## Questions for Clarification

[Question] Should the domain model include detailed validation rules for each field (e.g., minimum character requirements for problem statements mentioned in US-SM-4)?
[Answer] Yes

[Question] For US-SM-5, should the domain model support custom skills not found in predefined lists, or should we assume all skills come from the Skills Catalog in the shared model?
[Answer] We assume all skills come from the Skills Catalog in the shared model

[Question] For US-SM-6, should the domain model support both duration-based and end-date-based timeline specifications, or should we standardize on one approach?
[Answer] We standardize on one approach which is end-date-based timeline specifications.

[Question] For US-SM-8, what specific limitations should be placed on opportunity modifications after a Solution Architect is selected?
[Answer] No modification allowed

[Question] For US-SM-9, what is the defined timeframe for reactivating a cancelled opportunity?
[Answer] 90 days after cancellation
